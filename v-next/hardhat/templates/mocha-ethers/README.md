# A TypeScript Hardhat project using Mocha and Ethers

This project demonstrates basic Hardhat usecases within a TypeScript project. It comes with a minimal Hardhat configuration file and a test.

For integration testing it uses the Mocha test runner and the Ethers.js library for interacting with Ethereum nodes.

Try running the following commands to see Hardhat in action:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
```
